# VideoMaker

Work In Progress

JavaCV documentation is frugal, so learning it and all the jargon associated with video and audio processing isn't easy. This project aims to produce an app that demonstrates:
 - Writing video files with embedded and synchronised audio
 - Creation of title and end sequences
 - Recording of audio track to embed
 - Utilities for choosing media devices to use
 - Capture of video from webcam
