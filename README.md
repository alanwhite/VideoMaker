# VideoMaker

Work In Progress

JavaCV documentation is frugal, so learning it and all the jargon associated with video and audio processing isn't easy. This project aims to produce an app that demonstrates:
 - Writing video files with embedded and synchronised audio
 - Creation of title and end sequences
 - Recording of audio track to a cue
 - Capture of video from webcam to a cue
 - Utilities for choosing media devices to use
 
 ## Project Structure
 
 This is an eclipse project, with the needed libraries imported into the lib folder. 
 The JavaCV version therein is 1.3.2, and jars for macOS and both 32 and 64 bit windows included.
 
 Development platform is macOS 10.12.5, no testing on Windows has been performed.
